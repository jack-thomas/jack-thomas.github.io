<!--- This layout is based on the original minima home layout:
        - https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/_layouts/home.html

      I originally copied the home layout from the minima theme just to get rid of the RSS link, but I
      ended up editing much more significantly than that. The RSS link is present in v2.5.1 (which was
      released in 2019 and is the version that was automatically installed as a gem), but it was removed
      from the repo in the following commit:
      https://github.com/jekyll/minima/commit/f3de471bf38a14c5025319fdd541c30fe9f6916f

      Here are some links around minima releases:
        - https://github.com/jekyll/minima/releases
        - https://github.com/jekyll/minima/releases/tag/v2.5.1
