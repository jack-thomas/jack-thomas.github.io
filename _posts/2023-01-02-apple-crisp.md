## Ingredients

### Filling

- 4 cups (or more) apples
- 2 Tablespoons flour
- 1/2 teaspoon (heaping) cinnamon (preferably pie spice)
- 1 cup sugar

### Topping

- 3/4 cup oats
- 3/4 cup light brown sugar
- 3/4 cup flour
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/2 sticks cold butter

## Directions

1. Combine all filling ingredients (apples, flour, cinnamon or pie spice, and sugar) in large bowl and stir until apples absorb other ingredients. Pour into greased 9x9 baking dish.
2. Mix remaining dry ingredients (oats, brown sugar, flour, baking powder, and baking soda) in medium bowl, then cut in butter. Pour mixture into baking dish, and spread (using your hands) so as to evenly coat apple mixture.
3. Bake at 350 for 35-45 minutes, until top is evenly golden brown and inside is bubbly.
