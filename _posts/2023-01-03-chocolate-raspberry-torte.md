## Ingredients

- 3 pkg. (4 oz. each) semi-sweet chocolate, divided
- 3/4 cup butter or margarine
- 1 pkg. (3 oz.) JELL-O Raspberry Flavor Gelatin
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1/3 cup flour
- 1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans (optional)
- 1 tub (8 oz.) cool whip, thawed
- 1/2 cup fresh raspberries
- 1 Tbsp. powdered sugar

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 350Â°F.
2. Spray 9-inch round pan with cooking spray; cover bottom with waxed paper. Microwave 4 oz. chocolate and butter in large microwaveable bowl on HIGH 1-1/2 to 2 min. or until chocolate is almost melted, stirring after 1 min. Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Stir in dry gelatin mix and sugar until well blended. Add eggs; mix well. Stir in flour and nuts until well blended. Pour into prepared pan.
3. Bake 40 min. (**check early!**) or until toothpick inserted in center comes out with fudgy crumbs. (Do not overbake.) Cool in pan 5 min. Run small knife around side of pan to loosen edge. Invert onto wire rack; remove waxed paper. Cool cake completely.
4. Meanwhile, melt 4 oz. of the remaining chocolate as directed on package; spread onto waxed paper-covered baking sheet. Refrigerate 30 min.
5. Microwave remaining chocolate in large microwaveable bowl as directed on package. Whisk in COOL WHIP until well blended. Transfer cake to plate; frost with COOL WHIP mixture.
6. Use sharp knife to cut chocolate on baking sheet into 1-1/2- to 2-inch irregular-shaped pieces. Arrange on cake. Top with raspberries and powdered sugar.

I made this (with Mom) last night for their housewarming shindig (with John and Michelle Twohig, Kris and Mick Aase, and Kyle and Katie Viesselmann (sp?)). It was definitely a big hit. However, we felt that we overbaked it a little bit. That is, it was a bit dry. You should check it much earlier than the 40 min. that it calls for, so I added a note to the directions indicating as much.

I also always forget how flat the chocolate raspberry torte is. Perhaps it would be interesting to use two 6" cake pans instead (or double the recipe) and make this a layered cake. Mom doesn't think this is a good idea, and she's probably right.
