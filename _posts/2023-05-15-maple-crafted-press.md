## Notes

- <sup>(1)</sup>I have [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BY9RTNQ/), which I bought in April 2022 for \~\$15. It looks like the price has gone down since then. (I saw it at closer to \~\$10 in May 2023.) It's... fine.

Jack Thomas. This recipe is intended to mimic Caribou Coffee's Iced Crafted Press. I usually order it with caramel flavoring, but obviously I've replaced that with maple syrup here.
