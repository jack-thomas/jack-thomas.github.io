## Ingredients

- 2-4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- kosher salt, to taste
- black pepper, to taste
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon plus 1/2 cup canola oil
- 2 cups diced celery
- 2 cups diced bell pepper
- 4 cups diced yellow onion (~1 very large onion)
- 12 serrano peppers, sliced (seeds included)
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 8 ounces amber-style beer
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 1 teaspoon thyme
- black pepper, to taste
- cayenne pepper, to taste
- 4 bay leaves
- 1 pound andouille sausage, cut into 1/4-inch coins
- cooked white rice, for serving
- sliced scallions, for serving

## Directions

1. Season the chicken with salt, black pepper, and ~1 tablespoon canola oil. Broil it until slightly charred and golden, about 10-15 minutes. Set aside
2. Heat a thick bottomed 4-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the oil and flour and stir constantly with a whisk until the roux is dark brown.
3. Add the veggies and cook for a few minutes. Add the beer to deglaze, then add the stock, seasonings, and sausage. Bring the gumbo back to a simmer, stirring occasionally.
4. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours (or longer).
