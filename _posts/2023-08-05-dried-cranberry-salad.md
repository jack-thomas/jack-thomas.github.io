## Ingredients

### Dressing

- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard
- 3 tablespoons onion, chopped
- 1/3 cup white vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
- 1 cup salad oil

### Salad

- 1 bag mixed greens (Spring Mix is good)
- 1/2 cup almond slices, caramelized
- 1/2 red onion (small), thinly sliced
- 1 cup dried cranberries or craisins
- 1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled

## Directions

1. To make the dressing, mix all the ingredients (except the oil) in a blender or Cuisinart. Slowly add the oil while continuing to blend. Mixture will thicken. Chill until use (at least 2 hours). This will make enough for about 2 salads.
2. To caramelize the almonds, mix almonds with 2-3 tablespoons of sugar in a small saucepan, and then heat and stir until sugar melts and coats the almonds. Pour out onto foil to cool. Break apart.
