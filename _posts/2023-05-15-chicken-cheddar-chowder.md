## Ingredients

- 2 bacon slices
- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite size pieces
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1 cup diced red bell pepper
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 4 1/2 cups fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
- 1 3/4 cups diced peeled red potato
- 2 1/4 cups frozen whole-kernel corn
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups 2% low-fat milk
- 3/4 cup (3 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## Directions

1. Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crisp. Remove bacon from pan; crumble. Set aside. Add the chicken, onion, bell pepper, and garlic to drippings in the pan; saute 5 minutes. Add broth and potato, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduct heat, and simmer 20 minutes or until potato is tender. Add corn; stir well.
2. Lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup, and level with a knife. Place flour in a bowl. Gradually add milk, stirring with a whisk until blended; add to the soup. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 15 minutes or until thick, stirring frequently. Stir in the cheddar cheese, salt, and black pepper. Top with crumbled bacon.
