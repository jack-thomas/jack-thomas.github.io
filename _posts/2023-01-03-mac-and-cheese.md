## Ingredients

- 1 cup sour cream
- 2 (10 3/4 oz) cans condensed cheddar cheese soup
- 2 cups milk
- 8 tablespoons butter, melted
- 5 cups grated cheese (~20oz)
- 1 tsp dry mustard
- 1 tsp black pepper (or more, always more)
- 1 lb (1 box) uncooked elbow macaroni

## Directions

1. Boil water in a large pot. Once the water is boiling, add salt.
2. Combine all ingredients except the macaroni in a crock pot set to high. Cover and heat up while the macaroni boils, stirring occasionally. You want the cheese to be mostly melted when you add the macaroni.
3. Once the cheese sauce is nearing completion, boil the macaroni in water for 1 min less than what the package says for al dente. (Do not overcook or you'll have soggy noodles.) 
4. Once the macaroni is done boiling, transfer it directly to the cheese mixture. (Just the noodles, obviously. Don't transfer the boiling water!)
5. Drain the macaroni, return it to the pot, and add the cheese sauce. Stir to combine, and cook for a few minutes.

## Notes

- Sharp cheddar cheese is the standard here, but this recipe works really well with a spicier cheese. For example, I've used [Cabot Habanero Cheddar Cheese](https://www.cabotcheese.coop/product/habanero-cheddar-cheese/) (which you can get in a huge package from Costco) and [Blaser's Habanero Ghost Pepper Cheese](https://www.ellsworthcheese.com/product/blasers-premium-cheese/7-5-oz-blasers-habanero-ghost-pepper-cheese/), and both turned out excellent!
- Do not rinse the noodles before adding them to the cheese mixture. Also, it's okay if some of the pasta water comes over with the noodles. This will help with emulsification and make for a creamier sauce.
- You can mix a huge variety of things into mac and cheese once it's done cooking. There's a whole restaurant dedicated to that concept: MACS Mac and Cheese Shop. I strongly encourage you to check out [their menu](http://macandcheeseshop.com/menu/macs/) for inspiration if you're not close enough to visit. Otherwise, some standard mix-ins include bacon, sausage, chicken, pork, and other meats; peppers such as bell or jalapeño; and onions. You can also amp up the spice by adding hot sauce of any sort, [crispy garlic in chili oil](https://amazon.com/dp/B00BF028XQ/), or chili pastes such as [sambal oelek](https://amazon.com/dp/B000JMAVXA/) or [Calabrian chili paste](https://amazon.com/dp/B004ROGVCG/). The world is your oyster, but don't add oysters to mac and cheese.

This is the Mac and Cheese recipe that my mom started making fairly regularly when I was in high school (give or take). It was previously labeled "Mac and Cheese (Crock Pot)," but I've since just relabeled it to "Mac and Cheese" since it's the probably the recipe I'm looking for under that term.
