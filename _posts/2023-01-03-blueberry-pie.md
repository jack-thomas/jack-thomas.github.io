## Ingredients

- 4 pints fresh blueberries, rinsed, drained
- 5 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3/4 cup raw or granulated sugar, plus more for crust
- 1 egg
- 2 pie crusts (one for bottom, one for lattice)

## Directions

1. Toss blueberries, corn starch, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and sugar in large bowl. Let sit 30 minutes to soften berries and extract juices.
2. Preheat oven to 425 F. Place foil-lined baking sheet on center rack in oven (while preheating, that is).
3. Let crust sit at room temperature 5 minutes to soften. Roll out first crust, place into deep dish pie dish, and trim (leaving ~1/2" overhang). Roll out second crust, and cut into 1" strips (~12 strips). Pour filling into pie dish, smooth top, and top with lattice of prepared crust strips (trimming again and tucking ends under bottom crust).
4. Prepare egg wash by combining 1 egg with 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl. Brush edges and lattice lightly with egg wash, then sprinkle surface with sugar.
5. Optionally, chill pie in freezer for 10 minutes (perhaps while oven is preheating).
6. Place pie on preheated baking sheet. Bake pie 5 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 375 F. Continue to bake, checking at the 60- and 75-minute mark and loosely tenting with foil if browning too quickly, until crust is deep golden brown and juices are thick and vigorously bubbling, 75–90 minutes total (juices will start to bubble at around 75 minutes but will thicken and bubble faster in the last 15 minutes; don’t be tempted to pull it out until bubbles are really going). The internal temperature should reach 213 F.
7. Transfer pie to a wire rack and let cool at least 3 hours before serving. The internal temperature should be no more than 85 F when you cut into the pie.

I made this again a few nights ago, but I made it my new deep dish (very deep dish!) glass pie pans. The bottom crust wasn't baked enough, so I should probably par-bake next time. I should also make more of the crust recipe since there wasn't quite enough crust for such a deep pie pan.

Otherwise it was great! The filling turned out the same, so it was quite tasty. However, now that I'm using the deep dish pie pans, I could probably do the entire 4 pint recipe instead of cutting down to 3.

I made this last night (2019-06-15) based on [Bon Appétit's filling](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-blueberry-pie) with Smitten Kitchen's pie crust [ingredients](https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/03/extra-flaky-pie-crust/) and [method](https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/11/pie-crust-102-all-butter-really-flaky-pie-dough/). I made two pies with six pints blueberries total. That is, I multiplied the original filling recipe by 1.5x (split evenly between the two pies) and made the crust recipe twice. The crust recipe is now captured in a [separate Trello card](https://trello.com/c/oZw2q3rP/261-crust).

I baked the pies on two separate racks (i.e. one above the other) instead of next to each other due to pan size constraints. Because of this, I swapped them every time that I checked on them. (I checked at the 25, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 minute marks). When baking the pies, I accidentally missed the note about dropping the oven temperature to 375 until the 25 minute mark! This meant that the crusts were already pretty much finished browning well before they were supposed to be. To combat over-browning, I covered the pies completely in foil for the remaining baking time and corrected the temperature to 375. The inside took the entire 90 minutes.

Even though I technically only used three quarters of the amount of filling that [Bon Appétit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-blueberry-pie) suggested, there was plenty of filling. Both pies turned out excellent! (I gave half a pie to Mick Aase, gave another half to my parents, and saved an entire pie for Jessi and I.)
