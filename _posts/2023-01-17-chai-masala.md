## Ingredients

- 12 green cardamom pods
- 7 whole cloves
- 4 star anise
- 12 peppercorns (more crushed than you did last time)
- 6 slices ginger (skin okay)
- 3 cinnamon sticks
- 4 tablespoons loose leaf black tea
- 2 cups of water
- 2 cups milk
- 2+ teaspoons (adjust as desired) sugar, maple syrup, honey, or alternative

## Directions

1. Add the whole spices to a mortar and crush them lightly into smaller pieces.
2. Place crushed spices and water into a high-walled pot with water.
3. Bring to a boil, add tea, then turn heat down to medium-low. Simmer for two minutes or until tea and spices have released their flavor and color.
4. Add milk. Bring the chai to a boil on high heat, so that it starts aerating and bubbling to the top. Remove the pot from heat until the bubbles come down. Replace the pot on the burner and bring the chai back up again to a boil and remove from heat a second time until the bubbles go back down. Repeat 3-5 times total until you've achieved a creamy texture and the desired color.
5. Mix in sweetener of choice, simmering as necessary just long enough to dissolve.
6. Strain and serve.

Abby and I made a double batch of this today, and we thought that it could have used more of most of the spices. Here's what we used.

- 12 cardamom pods (leave this one the same next time)
- 2 star anise (use more next time)
- 12 peppercorns (use more next time, and crush them more next time)
- 1 cinnamon stick (use 3 next time)
- 4 cloves (use 6-7 next time)
- Ground ginger (actually use fresh, probably on the high side, next time)
- 4 tablespoons of tea (perfect)

We also thought that the sweeter results were better. We used maple syrup, but I think honey might be better next time.

This started as a combination of the recipes from [Masala and Chai](https://masalaandchai.com/masala-chai/) and [Feasting at Home](https://www.feastingathome.com/authentic-masala-chai-recipe/), but I've since heavily edited it as Abby and I have been making it.
