## Ingredients

- 5 large jalapeños
- 1 package bacon
- 1 package cream cheese
- Seasoning (seasoned salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper are a good option)

## Directions

1. Prepare jalapeños by cutting them in half and removing the seeds. In a bowl, mix cream cheese and seasonings.
2. Fill the inside of each jalapeño half with cream cheese mixture.
3. Wrap each filled jalapeño half in bacon, arranging in something like a casserole dish.
4. Bake at 400 until bacon looks done (~45 min).
