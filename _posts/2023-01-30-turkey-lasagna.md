## Ingredients

- 1/3 cup part-skim ricotta cheese
- 1 egg, scrambled
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup part-skim mozazrella cheese, divided
- Cooking oil spray
- 1 pound ground turkey
- 2 1/2 cups marinara, divided
- 1/4 cup fresh basil (or 1 tablespoon dried basil)
- 4 whole grain lasagna noodles (no-bake version)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425. Heat skillet over medium heat.
2. In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, egg, salt, and 1/4 cup mozzarella.
3. Spray skillet with cooking spray and add turkey. Cook, stirring often, until browned (about 3 min). Mix in 2 cups marinara sauce and basil. Turn off heat.
4. Spray a glass or ceramic 8-inch square (or 6x10) baking dish with cooking spray. Place 1/2 of the turkey mixture in the bottom on the pan. Cover with 4 noodle halves and half of the ricotta mixture.
5. Repeat and top with remaining 1/2 cup marinara sauce and remaining 1/4 cup mozzarella.
6. Cook for 25 minutes. Turn oven to broil and cook until top is brown, about 2 more minutes. Mom added more cheese for the last 3 minutes.
