## Ingredients

### Crust

- 20 graham crackers (1 pkg)
- 1/4 cup melted butter
- 2 tablespoons sugar

### Filling

- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3/4 lb (12 oz) Philadelphia *original* cream cheese

### Topping (Optional)

- 1 cup sour cream
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons sugar

## Directions

1. Make filling by beating eggs with electric beater until well blended. Add sugar, vanilla extract, and cream cheese. Continue beating until smooth. Set aside.
2. Crush graham crackers. Melt butter, add sugar, add crushed graham crackers, and combine. Press into bottom and sides of (greased) 9" pie pan to form crust. (You can also use a store-bought pie crust if you want.) Add filling to pie pan (on top of the crust, obviously).
3. Bake at 375 for 20 min.
4. (Optional) While pie is cooling, mix sour cream, sugar, and vanilla extract. Once pie is cooled, spread topping. Bake at 400 for 5 min.

## Notes

- My mom (Jodi Thomas) added a note: Bake for 25 min. and omit topping. It sounds like nobody really ever includes the topping.
