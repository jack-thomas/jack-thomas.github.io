## Ingredients

- 4 large bananas (mashed)
- 2 cups sugar
- 1/2 cup butter
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup buttermilk (1.5 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 cup milk)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 1/2 cups flour

## Directions

1. Make buttermilk by combining 1 cup milk and 1.5 tablespoons lemon juice. Let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.
2. Combine mashed bananas with remaining ingredients. Beat until well-mixed. (Don't do this all at once, though; beat as you go.)
3. Split among 3 loaf pans. Bake 45 min at 350.
