## Ingredients

- 1 can (10 1/2 ounces) Campbell's Cream of Chicken Soup
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1 cup Pace Picante Sauce
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 2 cups chopped cooked chicken
- 1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 6 (6-inch) flour tortilla, warmed
- 1 small tomato, chopped (about 1/2 cup)
- 1 green onion, sliced (about 2 tablespoons)

## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 350Â°F. Stir the soup, sour cream, picante sauce and chili powder in a medium bowl.
2. Stir 1 cup soup mixture, chicken and cheese in a large bowl.  Season the mixture with salt and pepper.
