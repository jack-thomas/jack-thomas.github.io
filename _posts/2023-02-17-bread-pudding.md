> Original title was "Apple-Raisin-Honey Bread Pudding with Maple Sauce"

## Ingredients

### Bread Mixture Ingredients

- 5 cups lightly packed cubed Italian Country Bread
- 2 cups milk
- 1/4 cup honey
- 2 Tablespoons sugar
- dash salt
- 1/2 cup raisins
- 2 medium McIntosh apples (peeled and sliced, ~2 cups)

### Custard Ingredients

- 3 eggs, room temperature
- 1 cup whipping cream
- 1/3 cup honey
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- dash salt
- 1 teaspoon nutmeg, divided

### Sauce Ingredients

- 1/4 cup water
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1/2 cup whipping cream
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon

## Directions

1. Heat broiler. Place bread in 15x10x1 pan. Boil 4 to 6 inches from hea 1-2 minutes or until light brown - turning once.
2. Heat oven to 350 F. Grease 2 quart glass baking dish. In large bowl, whisk together all remaining bread mixture ingredients, except raisins and apples. Stir in toasted bread and raisins. Let stand 3-5 minutes or until liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally. Add apples, stir gently to mix, and spoon into baking dish.
3. In large bowl, whisk eggs until mixed. Add all remaining custard ingredients, except nutmeg. Add 3/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Whisk custard until blended. Pour over bread mixture, making sure custard evenly coats. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.
4. Bake 55-65 minutes or until top is puffed and knife inserted comes out almost clean.
5. Meanwhile, prepare sauce. In small bowl, blend water and cornstarch until smooth. In small saucepan, cook 1/2 cup cream, syrup, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon over medium-hot heat, stirring often. Stir in cornstarch mixture. Bring to boil. Boil 2-3 minutes, or until thick enough to coat back of spoon, stirring constantly.

## Notes

- Mom's sticky note: I used almost an entire regular loaf of white bread. Also, I just toasted the bread and then cut it into pieces.
