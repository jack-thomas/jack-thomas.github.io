## Ingredients

- 1 cup flour$$^{1}$$
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 Tablespoon sugar$$^{2}$$
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 Tablespoon malted milk powder (optional)
- 1/2 cup milk$$^{3}$$
- 1 egg
- 1/2 Tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 Tablespoons butter, melted
- Optional mix-ins, including blueberries and chocolate chips

## Directions

Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and malted milk powder in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, add all remaining ingredients, and mix until mostly smooth.

## Notes

- $$^{1}$$: All purpose and self-rising both work here.
- $$^{2}$$: Alternatives to white sugar include:
    - 1 to 2 Tablespoon(s) honey (which you can heat up in the microwave for 15-20 seconds if it's not liquid enough)
    - 1/2 to 1 Tablespoon maple syrup
- $$^{3}$$: For a thinner, buttermilk pancake, substitute the 1 cup milk for 2 cups buttermilk plus 1/3 cup whole milk.
