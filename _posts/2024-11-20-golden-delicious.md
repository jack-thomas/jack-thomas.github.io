## Ingredients

- 2 ounces whiskey, preferably Angel's Envy
- 1 ounce lemon juice
- 1 ounce apple syrup (recipe follows)

## Directions

Combine with ice. Shake. Strain. (Or just build in the glass and stir.)

## Apple Syrup

- 4 cups brown sugar
- 4 cups water
- 6 apples, cored and quartered
- 4 cinnamon sticks

Add to saucepan. Barely simmer until apples are soft. Strain out apples (and mash them for some excellent applesauce.)

## Sources

This is a twist on the [Gold Rush](/gold-rush.html) - which itself is a twist on the [Bee's Knees](/bees-knees.html) - that Casey and I came up with when we were trying to figure out a way to use up some extra apples.
