## Directions

1. **Water**: Double check that there's enough water in the tank. Turn on the water, open the steam wand, and turn on the machine. (This is to ensure that the boiler has enough water that you don't burn the boiler element.) Once water is coming out consistently, you can close the steam wand and turn off the water. (Keep the machine on though, obviously.)
2. **Dry**: Make sure that your portafilter (basket included) is completely clean and dry.
3. **Grind** 16 grams coffee into portafilter. The current settings on your grinder are a grind time of 11.4 and a grind level of 14.
4. **Distribute** the coffee evenly around the basket.
5. **Tamp** the coffee in the basket.
6. **Pull Shot**: Use the PID to automatically pull the shot. Turn on the cup switch, then press the start button the PID. Alternatively, pull the shot manually:
    1. Turn the water on for about a second to begin pre-infusion. Turn the water switch off, and wait for another few seconds to allow pre-infusion to complete.
    2. Turn the water switch back on for 24 seconds to pull the shot. Turn the water switch off when you're done pulling the shot.
7. **Clean Up**:
    1. Remove the portafilter, knock out the puck, remove the basket, and wash the basket and the portafilter. Dry thoroughly and put away.
    2. Run a bit of extra water the machine (after removing the portafilter) to get rid of any coffee grinds that may have stuck to the machine while the portafilter was attached. This involves turning on both the cup and water switches. Run water through it until the water runs clear and grounds-free.
8. **Turn Off** the machine.
9. **Water**: Refill the water tank, as necessary.

## Notes

- Grind:
    - James Hoffmann recommends getting your whole beans slightly damp (i.e., by using a spritz of water before putting them through the grinder) to reduce static and decrease retention in the grinder. However, I'm storing my coffee beans in the grinder, so I don't think this is feasible for me at the moment.
    - James Hoffmann notes that when you're first starting out, it can be useful to weigh both the inputs and outputs when grinding. However, I'm storing my coffee beans in the grinder, so I don't think this is feasible for me at the moment.
- Distribute:
    - James Hoffman uses a dosing funnel (to prevent spillage) and a needle-based distribution tool to distribute the coffee. For now, just use your finger to get it level. See below: <br />![](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/espressomachines-grounds.gif)
    - Unfortunately, manual distribution is inconsistent. This is definitely a step you should improve upon.

I also appreciated this random morning routine YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/WKvsD_m1eDY) using an unmodified version of the same machine.
