Yep, the Del Maguey Vida Mezcal (with the smokiness bumped up by the Laphroaig) and the split sweetener of Cointreau and agave syrup is definitely the way to go. This is everything I want my mezcal margarita to be. I'm sticking with this build.

For the second version, I split the ounce of simple syrup into 1/2 ounce simple syrup and 1/2 ounce Cointreau. I later realized that this is the same as the [Employees Only's Mezcal Margarita](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/employees-onlys-mezcal-margarita/) (with the exception that it uses agave syrup instead of simple syrup). I also decided to include 1/4 ounce of Laphroaig.

The exact configuration was 2 ounces Del Maguey Vida, 1 ounce lime juice, 1/2 ounce Cointreau, 1/2 ounce simple syrup, and 1/4 ounce Laphroaig.

I really liked it, but I'm concerned that the Laphroaig overpowered the sublety of the mezcal. Next time, I'll probably make a version with it and a version without it to compare.

For the first version, I started with the Tommy's Margarita recipe from *Simonson, Robert (2016) A Proper Drink* (2 ounces tequila, 1 ounce lime, 1/2 ounce agave syrup), but I subbed the tequila for mezcal and the agave syrup for simple syrup. The latter substitution is just because I don't have any agave syrup on hand. I also doubled the simple syrup, thinking that the sweetness might be needed to play nicely with the smokiness of the mezcal.

The exact configuration was 2 ounces Del Maguey Vida, 1 ounce lime juice, and 1 ounce simple syrup.

In general, I found that this version was too basic. I wanted it to be smokier, and I realized that I usually include Cointreau in my margaritas. I'll make those changes next time!
