## Versions

###### 2023-08-14 Version 2

For the second version, I split the ounce of simple syrup into 1/2 ounce simple syrup and 1/2 ounce Cointreau. I later realized that this is the same as the [Employees Only's Mezcal Margarita](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/employees-onlys-mezcal-margarita/) (with the exception that it uses agave syrup instead of simple syrup). I also decided to include 1/4 ounce of Laphroaig.

The exact configuration was 2 ounces Del Maguey Vida, 1 ounce lime juice, 1/2 ounce Cointreau, 1/2 ounce simple syrup, and 1/4 ounce Laphroaig.

I really liked it, but I'm concerned that the Laphroaig overpowered the sublety of the mezcal. Next time, I'll probably make a version with it and a version without it to compare.

###### 2023-08-13 Version 1

For the first version, I started with the Tommy's Margarita recipe from *Simonson, Robert (2016) A Proper Drink* (2 ounces tequila, 1 ounce lime, 1/2 ounce agave syrup), but I subbed the tequila for mezcal and the agave syrup for simple syrup. The latter substitution is just because I don't have any agave syrup on hand. I also doubled the simple syrup, thinking that the sweetness might be needed to play nicely with the smokiness of the mezcal.

The exact configuration was 2 ounces Del Maguey Vida, 1 ounce lime juice, and 1 ounce simple syrup.

In general, I found that this version was too basic. I wanted it to be smokier, and I realized that I usually include Cointreau in my margaritas. I'll make those changes next time!
