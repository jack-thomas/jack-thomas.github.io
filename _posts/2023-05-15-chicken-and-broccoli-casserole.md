So... This isn't actually chicken pot pie. It's "chicken and broccoli casserole", but Mom called it chicken pot pie growing up, so that's what I'm calling it here!

## Ingredients

- 1 can (10 3/4 ounces) condensed cream of chicken soup
- 1/2 cup milk
- 2 cups seasoned diced cooked chicken
- 1 bag (12 oz) frozen broccoli cuts, thawed and drained
- 1 jar (2 ounces) diced pimientos, drained
- 1 pouch (7.75 ounces) Bisquick Complete cheese-garlic biscuit mix
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, if desired

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 425Â°F. Spray 2-quart casserole or 8-inch square glass baking dish with cooking spray. In casserole or baking dish, mix soup and milk until well blended. Stir in chicken, broccoli and pimientos.
2. Cover and bake casserole about 25 minutes or until bubbly.
3. About 5 minutes before removing casserole from oven, make biscuit mix as directed on package, using water. Drop dough by 8 large spoonfuls onto chicken mixture around the edges. Sprinkle with chives.
4. Bake uncovered 12 to 17 minutes or until bubbly and biscuits are golden brown.
