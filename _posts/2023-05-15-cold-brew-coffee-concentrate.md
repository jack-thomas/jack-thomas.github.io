Jack Thomas. This recipe was basically developed via trial and error. The important thing here is the grind setting and the ratio.

[Peace Coffee](https://www.peacecoffee.com/learn/brew-guides/cold-press/) suggests 12oz coffee to 8 cups water (3:2), rather than the current 1:1 ratio. Worth experimenting with?
