## Ingredients (Double Batch)

- 2 tablespoon refined or virgin coconut oil, or a neutral-flavored oil
- 1 bulb garlic, minced
- 4 inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and minced or grated
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh turmeric, or 2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 4+ serrano peppers, diced
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon Indian red chili powder
- 4 teaspoons curry powder
- 2 teaspoons garam masala
- Kosher salt or sea salt to taste (I use about 1 tsp kosher salt, and add more at the end)
- Freshly cracked black pepper to taste
- 1lb red lentils, or split red lentils (the split variety will cook a bit quicker)
- 4 cups water
- 1 28oz can crushed tomatoes
- 2 13.5oz cans full-fat coconut milk
- 6 tablespoons unsweetened creamy almond butter
- 1 small lemon, juiced
- 1 cup (~8g) fresh cilantro, roughly chopped (optional)
- For serving: Basmati or Jasmine rice and Indian flatbread such as roti, paratha, or naan

## Directions

1. Rinse the lentils in cold water until the water runs clear. Set aside.
2. Heat a large, deep skillet or large saucepan over medium-high heat and add the coconut oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add the garlic, ginger, fresh turmeric (if using), and Serrano pepper and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent garlic from burning.
3. Add the cumin, coriander, chili powder, curry powder, garam masala, salt, and black pepper to taste, and cook for 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant, tossing frequently to prevent burning. If using ground turmeric instead of fresh turmeric, add the ground turmeric now, along the the rest of the spices.
4. Pour in the vegetable broth, and use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot. Add in the lentils and the crushed tomatoes and mix well. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan with a lid. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through and have mostly softened. If you find that the lentils are not quite soft after 25 minutes, add a few spoons more of broth or water and cook for another 5 minutes.
5. Remove the lid and stir in the coconut milk, almond butter, along with salt and pepper to taste Continue cooking on low heat, uncovered for 5 to 8 minutes, until the curry has thickened and is creamy.
6. Finally, stir in the lemon juice and cilantro, and turn off the heat. If you want your lentils to even creamier and more on the puréed side, use an immersion blender to lightly purée the curry.
7. Serve the curry with rice and/or Indian flatbread and garnish with additional cilantro. Store leftovers in the fridge for 3-4 days.

Heating this up directly from frozen ends up a bit chalky, but not bad!

I made a double batch of this for lunch (and a shitload of leftovers) today. It's definitely worth doubling the batch because then you can use an entire 1lb bag of red lentils, the larger 28oz can of tomatoes, and a whole bulb of garlic.

Here's what I did differently:

- Doubled the recipe
- Used canola oil instead of coconut oil
- Added one red bell pepper (chopped)
- Added a bunch of chopped onion
- Used water instead of vegetable stock
- Didn't measure exact amount of spicy peppers - could have used more
- Used maple almond butter instead of regular almond butter (couldn't tell in the end)
- Skipped the cilantro

Regardless, this is a very good recipe! I just should have added a smidge more salt. Next time, I'd add some potatoes or something to give it more body. The changes are reflected, with the exception of the potato suggestion.
