## Ingredients

###### Steak Ingredients

- 2 filets mignons 8 ounces each, at least 2-inches thick
- 1 Tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 tsp kosher salt or to taste
- 1 tsp ground black pepper or to taste

###### Blue Cheese Crust Ingredients

- 1/4 cup blue cheese crumbles
- 2 Tbsp Panko bread crumbs
- 1 tsp Herbs de Provence or another blend of dried herbs
- 1/2 tsp olive oil

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Heat a large, well-seasoned, cast-iron skillet over high heat for 5-7 minutes.
3. Pat the steaks dry with a paper towel and brush them lightly with the vegetable oil. Season on all sides with the kosher salt and pepper.
4. While the skillet is heating, combine the ingredients for the blue cheese crust in a small bowl. Set aside.
5. When the skillet is hot, add the filets and sear on the top, bottom and all sides. This will take about 1-2 minutes per side. Be sure to have your exhaust fan on high because the steaks and pan will produce smoke.
6. When all sides of the filets have been seared, top with the cheese-panko mixture and place in the oven. Cook the steaks for about 6 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the filet registers 125 ° F for rare (cool red center), 135 ° F for medium-rare (warm red center), or 145° F for medium (warm pink center).
7. Carefully, remove the filets from the oven using a heavy-duty potholder. Place the meat on a platter, cover with aluminum foil or a plate and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- Cooking times for the filets will vary depending on the size and thickness of the steaks. Use a meat thermometer to ensure that the steaks are cooked to your preferred degree of doneness.
- Be sure to turn your kitchen exhaust fan to high because this recipe produces a lot of smoke. If you are like me and don't have a good exhaust fan, open a window, or your smoke alarm might go off.
