> This recipe makes two pie crusts, which is sufficient for one double-crust pie (e.g. blueberry) or two single-crust pies (e.g. pumpkin).

## Ingredients

- 225g Tenderflake pure leaf lard
- 1 large egg
- 1 Tbsp white vinegar
- Cold water
- 3 cups pastry flour
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp coarse salt

## Directions

1. Cut up lard and put in the freezer.
2. In a measuring cup, whisk together the egg and the vinegar. Add enough cold water to make 125 mL (½ cup), and stir.
3. Add half the flour, sugar, and salt to a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the frozen lard and pulse to create what looks like peas coated in flour. Add the remaining flour and pulse a few more times. While pulsing, slowly drizzle in the cold liquid. (Only add enough liquid for the dough to start coming together. You most likely won’t need all fo the liquid.)
4. Dump the crumbly dough out onto the counter, and carefully bring together with your hands. Divide in two, pat each half into a disk.
5. Wrap and refrigerate at least one hour.
