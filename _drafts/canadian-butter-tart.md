## Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 2 cups packed brown sugar
- 2 Tbsp vinegar
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1/2 cup butter, melted
- 1 1/3 cup currants, chopped raisins, dates, figs, or nutmeats
- Pastry for 18 tart shells (e.g., [butter](/pie-crust-butter.html) or [lard](/pie-crust-lard.html) pie crusts)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450F.
2. Beat eggs, then beat in sugar vinegar, and vanilla. Stir in melted butter and fruit.
3. Fill tart shells 1/2 to 1/3 full with mixture.
4. Bake at 450F for 10 minutes then reduce temp to 375F and bake 15-18 minutes more, or until crust is golden brown and filling is firm.

## Notes

- There are other recipes that use corn syrup, molasses, and maple syrup for some or all of the sweetener. Given how much you (and Canadians) like maple syrup, that might be an interesting substitution to make. I'm thinking that substituting 1 cup of the brown sugar for 1 cup of maple syrup might be a good starting point.

Glen And Friends Cooking has a few videos, including versions from [1900](https://youtu.be/VpMVyw3RQAY), [1939](https://youtu.be/v6UTjHBngos), [1944](https://youtu.be/QrdzC5NGpss), and [1970](https://youtu.be/QrdzC5NGpss). The version here is the 1944 version, but you should try a few different ones.
