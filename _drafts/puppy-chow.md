## Ingredients

- 1 (12-ounce) box of Chex
- 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips (10 ounces)
- 3/4 cup smooth peanut butter
- 6 Tbsp (3/4 stick) unsalted butter
- 1/4 to 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 1/2 tsp vanilla
- 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar, divided

## Directions

1. Pour cereal into a gallon Ziploc bag.
2. Add chocolate, peanut butter, butter, and salt to a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 1 minute. Stir, then continue microwaving in 15-second intervals, stirring each time, until mostly melted, about 45 seconds more. Stir until smooth. Stir in the vanilla.
3. Add the chocolate mixture to the bag, and toss until the cereal is evenly coated.
4. Add the powdered sugar to the bag, and toss until the cereal is evenly coated.
5. Cool in fridge (or freezer).

## Notes

- The OG puppy chow recipe from Chex called for 9 cups of the cereal rather than a whole box, which is very annoying. Thankfully, this version just uses a whole box.
- The Kitchn recipe that I used here called for you to pour the chocolate mixture over the Chex on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, but that seems unnecessary when you can just do everything in the bag.
