## Ingredients

### Crust Ingredients

- 250 g flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 3 Tbsp icing sugar
- 140 g butter
- 2 medium egg yolks
- 2-3 Tbsp cold water

### Filling Ingredients

- 1 bottle (325 ml) Lyle's Golden Syrup
- lemon zest
- ground ginger
- 3 Tbsp heavy cream
- 1 egg
- 1 1/4 cup breadcrumbs (MAKE YOUR OWN)

## Directions

1. Make your own breadcrumbs by letting your bread sit out for a day (or toast it) and then pulse in a food processor.
2. Make the pastry. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut butter into small cubes and blend with a pastry blender. Stir in icing sugar, egg yolks, and 2 Tbsp water. Blend with pasty blender. Form into a ball, wrap, and store in the fridge for 30 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 400 F, and put a baking sheet in the oven (to catch drips).
4. Roll out the pastry, and line the tart pan with it. Prick with a fork. Line with parchment paper, and fill with pie weights, dry beans, or sugar. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the parchment, prick with a fork, and bake for a further 10 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.
5. Lower the oven to 325 F.
6. Make the filling. Heat up the syrup in a pan over low heat. Stir in the lemon zest and ground ginger. Beat the egg and cream together in a separate bowl, and then add to the syrup mixture. Stir through breadcrumbs. Pour into pastry.
7. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the filling is just set.
8. Let cool for 20 minutes before serving.

I (Jack) made this today for Danielle Aase's wedding shower. It's a very flexible recipe, and recipes online vary quite considerably. Basically, whatever you have will be fine.
