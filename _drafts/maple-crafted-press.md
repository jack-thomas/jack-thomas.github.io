## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup [cold brew concentrate](/cold-brew-coffee-concentrate.html)
- 1/2 cup water (milk?)
- 2 Tablespoons cream (skip with milk?)
- 2 Tablespoons maple syrup (more?)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt (currently omitted, but should probably be added back in)

## Directions

1. Mix together with an electric whisk / milk frother<sup>(1)</sup>.

## Notes

- <sup>(1)</sup>I have [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BY9RTNQ/), which I bought in April 2022 for \~\$15. It looks like the price has gone down since then. (I saw it at closer to \~\$10 in May 2023.) It's... fine.
