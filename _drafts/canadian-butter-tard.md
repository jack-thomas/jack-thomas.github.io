Glen And Friends Cooking has a few videos, including versions from [1900](https://youtu.be/VpMVyw3RQAY), [1939](https://youtu.be/v6UTjHBngos), [1944](https://youtu.be/QrdzC5NGpss), and [1970](https://youtu.be/QrdzC5NGpss). The version here is the 1944 version, but you should try a few different ones.
