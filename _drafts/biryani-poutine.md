This recipe is from [Uzma Jalaluddin](https://www.instagram.com/uzmajalaluddin/). She came up with the general concept for her book, [Hana Khan Carries On](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53746115-hana-khan-carries-on). She shared the recipe herein on her Instagram as two posts: [biryani](https://www.instagram.com/p/COVtVOarXRe/) and [poutine](https://www.instagram.com/p/COZD3SnL28P/). *However*, the poutine recipe is just a picture and not really a recipe. You'll need to figure out how to approach it.
