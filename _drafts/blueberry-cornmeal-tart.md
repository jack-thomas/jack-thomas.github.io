## Ingredients

### Crust & Topping Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups/225g all-purpose flour
- 1/3 cup/55 grams cornmeal
- 1/3 cup/50 grams confectioners’ sugar
- 1/4 cup/55 grams light brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon/ 4 grams baking powder
- 1 teaspoon/ 3 grams kosher salt
- 3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), melted and cooled slightly

### Filling Ingredients

- 1 pound/455 grams blueberries, or combination of blueberries, blackberries and raspberries
- 1/2 cup/110 grams light brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons/28 grams apple cider vinegar or fresh lemon or lime juice
- 2 tablespoons/18 grams all-purpose flour
- Pinch of kosher salt

## Directions

1. **Make the crust and topping**: Preheat oven to 350°. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal,
confectioners’ sugar, brown sugar, baking powder and salt. Add melted butter, then use your hands or a wooden
spoon to combine ingredients until a coarse little dough comes together, with no obviously dry spots.
2. Press 3/4 of the cornmeal mixture into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom (alternatively, use a 9-inch cake
pan or springform pan, or 8x8 pan lined with parchment), making sure the mixture is evenly pressed on the bottom
and about 1/2 inch up the sides. (Using something large and flat, like the bottom of a measuring cup, will be helpful.)
Place the shell on a rimmed baking sheet; pop the tart shell and remaining mixture into the fridge while you prepare
the filling.
3. **Make the filling**: Toss blueberries, brown sugar, vinegar, flour and salt together in a medium bowl. Pour the fruit
into the crust.
4. Crumble the remaining cornmeal mixture over the blueberries, pressing bits of the mixture together into large
clumps as you go, as you would with a crisp or coffee-cake topping (note that it won’t cover the top entirely, more
just create a nice sporadic covering, still allowing the blueberries and their juices to poke through).
5. **Bake** tart until the blueberry filling is bubbly and thickened, and both the crust and top are nicely browned, 50–55
minutes.
6. Let tart cool completely before slicing into triangles and serving. The tart can be baked up to 2 days ahead and
stored tightly wrapped at room temperature or refrigerated (especially if your kitchen is hot or humid).
