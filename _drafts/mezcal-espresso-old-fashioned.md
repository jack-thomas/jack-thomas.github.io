This is more of an attempt to recreate the general idea of a "Mezcal Espresso Old Fashioned," which is how that bartender summarized the drink. I basically started by combining the Oaxaca Old Fashioned and Espresso Martini cocktails as a starting point. The exact configuration was 2 ounces Del Maguey Vida Mezcal, 1 ounce espresso (chilled), 4 dashes chocolate bitters, and a maraschino cherry garnish.

I don't think the Del Maguey Vida Mezcal was a good choice. It's not smokey enough. Perhaps next time I should take the same route I took to adjust the [Mezcal Margarita](/mezcal-margarita.html). <!--- TO DO: I haven't actually made this yet. --->

The bartender at [The Red Accordion](https://www.theredaccordion.com/) (which was easily my favorite of the places that we visited in Vancouver) made this for me when I asked for something interesting. Apparently it was a cocktail that he was workshopping based on something that he had elsewhere. He told me the name, and he told me where he tried it, but I don't remember either of those details, unfortunately.

Overall, I really enjoyed his version! The only thing I'd change is to have the mezcal be a bit more forward and a bit smokier. The bartender admitted that he was targeting people who are new to mezcal and/or spirit-forward cocktails, which makes sense.
