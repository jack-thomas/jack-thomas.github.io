## Versions

#### 2023-08-xx Version 3

I increased the sweetness and switched to cold brew coffee for the third version.

- 2 ounces Del Maguey Vida Mezcal
- 1 ounce cold brew coffee
- 1/2 ounce Cointreau
- 1/2 ounce simple syrup
- 6 dashes orange bitters

Build in a rocks glass with ice. Stir. Garnish.

#### 2023-08-14 Version 2

The second version of this was an attempt to go back in the "old fashioned" direction.

- 2 ounces Del Maguey Vida Mezcal
- 1 ounce espresso (chilled)
- 6 dashes orange bitters
- 1 barspoon maraschino cherry syrup
- 3 maraschino cherries, for garnish

Build in a rocks glass with ice. Stir. Garnish.

I can't exactly decide what's wrong here either. It was drinkable, but I think it was short on the sweetness. Maybe I should include some Cointreau or simple syrup or something.

#### 2023-08-15 Version 1

This is more of an attempt to recreate the general idea of a "Mezcal Espresso Old Fashioned," which is how that bartender summarized the drink. I basically started by combining the Oaxaca Old Fashioned and Espresso Martini cocktails as a starting point. The version I started with was more of a "Mezcal Espresso Martini," probably.

- 1 ounce Del Maguey Vida Mezcal
- 1 ounce Mr. Black Coffee Liqueur
- 1 ounce espresso (chilled)
- 4 dashes orange bitters
- 4 dashes cocoa bitters

Shake with ice. Strain into a chilled coupe.

This version started off pretty bland, so I added 1/4 ounce of Laphroaig - thinking that maybe cranking up the smoke would help. It didn't really help, and it felt like all of the flavors kind of cancelled each other out. I dumped it down the drain.

The bartender at [The Red Accordion](https://www.theredaccordion.com/) (which was easily my favorite of the places that we visited in Vancouver) made this for me when I asked for something interesting. Apparently it was a cocktail that he was workshopping based on something that he had elsewhere. He told me the name, and he told me where he tried it, but I don't remember either of those details, unfortunately.

Overall, I really enjoyed his version! The only thing I'd change is to have the mezcal be a bit more forward and a bit smokier. The bartender admitted that he was targeting people who are new to mezcal and/or spirit-forward cocktails, which makes sense.
