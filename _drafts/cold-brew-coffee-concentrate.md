## Ingredients

- 4 oz coarsely ground coffee
- 4 cups water

Hmm... [Peace Coffee](https://www.peacecoffee.com/learn/brew-guides/cold-press/) suggests 12oz coffee to 8 cups water (3:2). My previous ratio was 1:1.

## Directions

1. Steep for ~20 hours.

This recipe was basically developed via trial and error. The important thing here is the grind setting and the ratio.
