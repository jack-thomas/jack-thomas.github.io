## Directions

1. **Dry**: Make sure that portafilter is completely dry!
2. **Paper Filter**: Optional! Add a paper filter to the bottom of your basket.
3. **Grind** 13-15(-18) grams coffee into portafilter. That's a grind time of **TODO** at grind level **TODO** on your grinder.
4. **Distribute** the coffee evenly around the basket.
5. **Tamp**.
6. **Pull Shot**. Time it! Aim for 24-30 seconds to start out.

## Notes

- Grind:
    - James Hoffmann recommends getting your whole beans slightly damp (i.e., by using a spritz of water before putting them through the grinder) to reduce static and decrease retention in the grinder. However, I'm storing my coffee beans in the grinder, so I don't think this is feasible for me at the moment.
    - James Hoffmann notes that when you're first starting out, it can be useful to weigh both the inputs and outputs when grinding. However, I'm storing my coffee beans in the grinder, so I don't think this is feasible for me at the moment.
- Distribute:
    - James Hoffman uses a dosing funnel (to prevent spillage) and a needle-based distribution tool to distribute the coffee. For now, just use your finger to get it level. See below: <br />![](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/espressomachines-grounds.gif)
    - Unfortunately, manual distribution is inconsistent. This is definitely a step you should improve upon.
- Pull Shot:
    - Learn about pre-infusion.
